PROYECT NAME/GROUP
---------------------

 * Introduction
-----
The introduction (required) shall consist of a brief paragraph or two that summarizes the purpose and function of this project. This introduction may be the same as the first paragraph on the project page.

The introduction should include a link to the project page and issue queue. If the project is a sandbox, these links should go to the sandbox until promotion.

 * Requirements
-----
    The requirements section (required) shall make it clear whether this project requires anything outside of Drupal core to work (modules, libraries, etc). List all requirements here, including those that follow indirectly from another module, etc. The idea is to inform the users about what is required, so that everything they need can be procured and included in advance of attempting to install the module. If there are no requirements, write "No special requirements".
    
 * Recommended modules
-----
This optional section lists modules that are not required, but that may enhance the usefulness or user experience of your project. Make sure to describe the benefits of enabling these modules.

 * Installation
-----
The installation section (required*) shall make it clear how to install the module. However, if the steps to install the module follow the standard instructions for Drupal 8, Drupal 7, Drupal 6/5, or a theme, don't reinvent the wheel — simply provide a link and explain in detail any steps that may diverge from these steps. Take special note of Drush integrations. In a case where many Drush commands are added, consider adding a section for Drush.

Consider replacing this section with a standalone INSTALL.txt file if your installation instructions are especially complex.
    
 * Configuration
-----
The configuration section (required) is necessary even when little configuration is required. Use this section to list special notes about the configuration of this module – including but not limited to permissions. This section is particularly important if the module requires additional configuration outside of the Drupal UI.

If the module has little or no configuration, you should use this space to explain how enabling/disabling the module will affect the site.

 * Troubleshooting & FAQ
-----
    These sections are optional. If present, they should address questions that are asked frequently in the issue queue (this will save you time in the future). Outline common problems that people encounter along with solutions (links are okay if the steps are long, but it is often helpful to provide a summary since links sometimes go stale).
